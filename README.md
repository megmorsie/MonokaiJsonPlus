# Sublime Monokai JSON+ Theme
 
The default Sublime Monokai Theme extended by rules that color JSON nicely up to 10 Levels!

## Examples
![alt text](img/dictionary.png "Dictionary")
![alt text](img/array.png "Array")
![alt text](img/mixed.png "Mixed")

## Installation

1. Copy the MonokaiJSON+.tmTheme file to your Sublime 2/3 Package Folder:
	
	cp MonokaiJSON+.tmTheme ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/
2. Go to: `Sublime Text/Preferences/Color Scheme` and select the MonokaiJSON+ Theme

## Customization

Take a look at the code/generateRules.py python script. It generates the JSON rules needed to color the multiple levels and all possible combinations of arrays, dictionaries and strings.

1. You can customize the colors or add/remove levels.
2. Run the python script: `python generateRules.py`
3. Open your own Sublime Theme and remove all existing JSON rules (search for 'json')
3. Copy the script output at the end of all other rules just before the `</array>`
